You will need to make sure to first preprocess and clean the price values because LightGBM can only handle numerical values (no strings or datetime objects). Once you have the price for each game, you can merge this data into your candidate dataframes (e.g. `pd.merge(df_train, df_item_price, on=\"item_id\")`). Make sure add the features to both `df_test` and `df_train`."
